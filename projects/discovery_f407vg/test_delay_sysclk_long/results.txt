results-short-delay_sysclk_long.txt is the output from setting the requested
delay to use 16 bits, results-long-delay_sysclk_long.txt uses delay of 35 bits.

The difference between the first and last columns (delay and absolute_fine_time)
is between 14 and 20 cycles.

Two cycles of this is accounted for by the second ldr instruction of the cycle
counter.  This means that cycle count for the call and return to
delay_sysclk_long exceeds its argument by 12-18 cycles.

This is one more than found in the test_delay_sysclk unit tests.  According to
the Cortex M3 and M4 TRMs the cycle count of call and return instructions is
variable between 2 and 4 cycles each depending on context (so calling a
completely empty function takes between 4 and 8 cycles).  In the context of this
unit test it takes one more cycle than in the other.

To verify that this is the case and that delay_sysclk_long is not behaving
differently from delay_sysclk, the call in test_delay_sysclk_long was replaced
with one to delay_sysclk.  The results in results-short-delay_sysclk.txt show
the same column difference as results-short-delay_sysclk_long.txt.

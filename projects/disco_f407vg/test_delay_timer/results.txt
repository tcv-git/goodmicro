The difference between the first and last columns (delay and absolute_fine_time)
is between 14 and 30 cycles.

Two cycles of this is accounted for by the second ldr instruction of the cycle
counter.  This means that cycle count for the call and return to
the delay function exceeds its argument by 12-28 cycles.

This is one more than found in the GPIO based tests.  According to the Cortex M3
and M4 TRMs the cycle count of call and return instructions is variable between
2 and 4 cycles each depending on context (so calling a completely empty function
takes between 4 and 8 cycles).  In the context of this unit test it takes one
more cycle than in the other.
